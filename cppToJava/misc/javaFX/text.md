<div id="body">

JavaFX is a technology for building Java-based GUIs. Previously it was a part Java itself, but has become a third-party dependency since then. It is now being maintained by [OpenJDK](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/OpenJFX).

##### JavaFx 9 tutorial

Adapted (with permissions) from [Marco Jakob's JavaFX 8 tutorial](http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/). Thanks to [Marco Jakob](https://github.com/marcojakob) for allowing us to adapt his tutorials for IntelliJ.

Table of contents:

* [Part 1: Scene Builder](part01/)
* [Part 2: Model and TableView](part02/)

After going through the two parts, you should be familiar with working with IntelliJ. You can continue with the original tutorial (which is written for Eclipse), with the following links:

* [Part 3: Interacting with the User](http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/part3/)
* [Part 4: CSS Styling](http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/part4/)
* [Part 5: Storing Data as XML](http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/part5/)
