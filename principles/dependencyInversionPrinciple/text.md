Example:

<img src="{{baseUrl}}/principles/dependencyInversionPrinciple/images/payrollEmployee.png" height="130" />
<p/>

In design (a), the higher level class `Payroll` depends on the lower level class `Employee`, a violation of DIP. In design (b), both `Payroll` and `Employee` depends on the Payee interface (note that inheritance is a dependency).

Design (b) is more flexible (and less coupled) because now the `Payroll` class need not change when the `Employee` class changes.
