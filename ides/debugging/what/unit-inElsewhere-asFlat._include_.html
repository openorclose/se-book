        <p><strong><em>Debugging</em> is the process of discovering defects in the program.</strong> Here are some approaches to debugging:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <font color="red"><span><strong><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></span></span> Bad</strong>
              </span>
            </font> -- <strong>By inserting temporary print statements</strong>: This is an ad-hoc approach in which print statements are inserted in the program to print information relevant to debugging, such as variable values. e.g. <code>Exiting process() method, x is 5.347</code>.
            This approach is not recommended due to these reasons.
            <ul>
              <li>Incurs extra effort when inserting and removing the print statements.</li>
              <li>These extraneous program modifications increases the risk of introducing errors into the program.</li>
              <li>These print statements, if not removed promptly after the debugging, may even appear unexpectedly in the production version.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <font color="red"><span><strong><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></span></span> Bad</strong>
              </span>
            </font> -- <strong>By manually tracing through the code</strong>: Otherwise known as ‘eye-balling’, this approach doesn't have the cons of the previous approach, but it too is not recommended (other than as a 'quick try') due to these reasons:
            <ul>
              <li>It is difficult, time consuming, and error-prone technique.</li>
              <li>If you didn't spot the error while writing code, you might not spot the error when reading code too.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <font color="green"><span><strong><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></span></span> Good</strong>
              </span>
            </font> -- <strong>Using a debugger</strong>: A debugger tool allows you to pause the execution, then step through one statement at a time while examining the internal state if necessary. Most IDEs come with an inbuilt debugger. <strong>This is the recommended approach for debugging</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
