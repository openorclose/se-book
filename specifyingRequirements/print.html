                  Trello, Google Docs, ...) to manage user stories digitally.</p>

                  <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early stages of requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
                  <box>
                    <p><span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer
                        with others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed">e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
                      <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed">e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
                      <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
                      <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>                        When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
                      <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
                      <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it.
                        Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>One of the biggest misunderstandings with user stories is how they differ from traditional requirements specifications. The biggest difference is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make a reasonably
                    low risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story developers will go to the customer and receive a detailed description of the requirements face to face.</p>

                      Rumbaugh, Grady Booch and Ivar Jacobson (also known as the Three Amigos). Each of them has developed their own notation for modeling software systems before joining force to create a unified modeling language (hence, the term ‘Unified’
                      in UML). UML is currently the <em>de facto</em> modeling notation used in the software industry.</p>

              <p><strong>You can use actor generalization in use case diagrams</strong> using a symbol similar to that of UML notation for inheritance.</p>
              <box>
                <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> In this example, actor <code>Blogger</code> can do all the use cases the actor <code>Guest</code> can do, as a result of the actor generalization relationship given in the
                  diagram.</p>
                <img src="/se-book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/actorGeneralisation.png" height="250"></box>
              <p><span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> Do not over-complicate use case diagrams by trying to include everything possible. A use case diagram is a brief summary of the
                use cases that is used as a starting point. Details of the use cases can be given in the use case descriptions.</p>
              <p><strong>Some include ‘System’ as an actor to indicate that something is done by the system itself without being initiated by a user or an external system.</strong></p>
              <box>
                <p><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-cube"></span></span> The diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports at midnight.</p>
                <img src="/se-book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="200"></box>
              <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that ‘view daily report’ should be the use case and <code>generate daily report</code>                is not to be shown in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the <code>view daily report</code> use case.</p>
              <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for modeling behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
              <p><strong>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case.</strong> Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph. Use cases should be easy to read. Note
                that there is no strict rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
              <p><strong>There are some advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Because they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
                <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
                <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
                <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system.</strong> Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify requirements.</p>
