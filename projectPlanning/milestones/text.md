**A _milestone_ is the end of a stage which indicates a significant progress.** We should take into account dependencies and priorities when deciding on the features to be delivered at a certain milestone.

{{ icon_example }} Each intermediate product release is a milestone.

In some projects, it is not practical to have a very detailed plan for the whole project due to the uncertainty and unavailability of required information. In such cases, we can use a high-level plan for the whole project and a detailed plan for the next few milestones.
